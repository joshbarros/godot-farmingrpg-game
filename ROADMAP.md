> **Last Updated:** December 29, 2025 at 22:06
> **Status:** On Hold - Returning in 2027
> **Progress:** Prototype ~15% complete

## Game Vision: Animal Crossing + Stardew Valley

**The Perfect Blend:**
- **From Animal Crossing:** Relaxed exploration, island/town customization, adorable villagers with unique personalities, real-time events, decorating freedom, debt-free progression vibes
- **From Stardew Valley:** Satisfying farming loop, meaningful progression, romance/marriage, mining/fishing/foraging, seasonal crops, community center goals

**Unique Hook Ideas:**
1. **Cozy Mystery Farm** - Inherited a magical farm, villagers have secrets, uncover the town's history while farming
2. **Seasons of Friendship** - Each villager has a deep storyline that unfolds over seasons, your choices matter
3. **Living World** - Villagers have their own lives, relationships evolve without you, miss events = they happen anyway
4. **Farm Customization** - Animal Crossing-level decoration freedom on your farm plots

## Notes

**Why Animal Crossing + Stardew Works:**
- AC provides the "vibe" - relaxed, charming, no pressure
- Stardew provides the "loop" - goals, progression, satisfaction
- Together: A game that's relaxing but never boring

**Key Differentiator Ideas:**
1. Villagers that feel MORE alive than either game
2. Your choices actually change the town over time
3. Mysteries to solve while farming
4. Deeper customization than Stardew
5. More structured goals than Animal Crossing

**Remember:** The goal isn't to clone either game, but to take the BEST of both and add our own magic.
